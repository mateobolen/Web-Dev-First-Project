        <h2>What to know about deciduous trees!</h2>
        <p>
      Deciduous trees are trees that lose all of their leaves for part of the year—usually in the autumn. 
      This process helps them conserve water and energy during the colder or drier seasons. 
      When spring arrives, they grow new leaves again, marking the start of a fresh growing cycle.
    </p>

    <h2>Common Examples of Deciduous Trees</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Oak:</strong> Known for their strength and long lifespan, oaks produce acorns and have broad leaves.</li>
      <li><strong>Maple:</strong> Famous for their vibrant red and orange autumn colors and sweet sap used to make syrup.</li>
      <li><strong>Birch:</strong> Recognizable by their distinctive white bark and slender trunks.</li>
      <li><strong>Elm:</strong> Popular shade trees with tall, arching branches.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Why Do They Lose Their Leaves?</h2>
    <p>
      As days grow shorter and temperatures drop, deciduous trees stop producing chlorophyll—the green pigment 
      in leaves that helps capture sunlight. This reveals other pigments, turning the leaves brilliant shades 
      of red, orange, and yellow before they fall. Shedding leaves prevents water loss and protects the tree 
      from damage during winter.
    </p>

    <h2>The Importance of Deciduous Trees</h2>
    <p>
      Deciduous forests support a wide variety of animals, insects, and plants. 
      They help regulate temperature, produce oxygen, and enrich the soil with nutrients from their fallen leaves. 
      These trees are vital to the balance and beauty of many ecosystems around the world.
