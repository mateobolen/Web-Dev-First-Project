        <h2>What Are Evergreen Trees?</h2>
        <p>
        Evergreen trees have waxy coatings on their leaves or needles to reduce water loss. 
        Their dark green color helps them absorb sunlight efficiently during the colder months. 
        These adaptations allow evergreens to survive in harsh environments where other trees cannot.
